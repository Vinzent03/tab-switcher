# Cycle through Panes ![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/phibr0/cycle-through-panes) ![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/phibr0/cycle-through-panes) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/phibr0/cycle-through-panes/total)

__This Plugin uses Code from [Vinadon](https://github.com/Vinzent03)__

_In Combination with Mr. Jackphils Jump to Link plugin and Vim Keybindings, this plugin allows you to control Obsidian entirely without a Mouse!_

## How to use

- `Ctrl + Tab` to switch open Editor/Preview Tabs
- `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` to switch open Editor/Preview Tabs in reverse order
- Set hotkey in settings to focus on last active pane
- **MacOS:** The Default Hotkeys do **not** work, you need to set your own in Settings > Hotkeys > Cycle through Panes

### Important

The only supported pane type is markdown, because I thought its the only pane type where it makes sense to switch to.
